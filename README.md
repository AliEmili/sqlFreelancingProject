# sqlFreelancingProject
This is a freelancing project to create a database and its tables including 4 queries, unfortunately the customer wanted this project to be in Persian and I don't want to spent my time translating it to English, I just shared it here as it was.
<br/>
This database includes 5 tables including :
<br/>
- Students
- Lessons
- Get_lessons
- Educations 
- Teachers
<br/>
queries includes :
- Creating tables and inserting the data
- Phone number and address of the student called "Ali Ahamdi"
- First name and last name of the student with the average score of 18
- List of students who got the lesson called "Database"
- List of students who got the classes whose teacher is called "Abbasi"
